I decided to study Civil Management Engineering because since I was a kid I was amazed by building and creating new things.</p><p>When I was at the university I worked full time as administrative assistant and later on as an assistant project manager, it was definitely a challenge for me to work full time and attend the classes at night but all the effort was worth it because it equipped me with a valuable knowlogde.</p><p>I also got married while I was in the university, and the dream of living in Canada grew even more. My husband found a job in Winnipeg to work at SkipTheDishes as a software developer and we came right after my graduation.</p><p>In Winnipeg I was able to find a job in retail and improve my English skills. Besides all the friends that we made in Winnipeg and the opportunities which were open to us there, we got in love with Calgary and its beautiful mountains which reminds us of our hometown.</p><p>Right after I moved to Calgary I decided to face the challenge of changing careers and engaging in the IT world and I’m very excited about this new journey.</p></div><img src="img/devnai-02.jpeg" alt="Naiara in the lake" class="about-me__img"></section><section class="my-work" id="work"><h2 class="section__title section__title--work">My project</h2><p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--work">One of many that are yet to come</p><div class="portfolio"><a href="portfolio-item.html" class="portfolio__item"><img src="img/portfolio-01.jpeg" alt="" class="portfolio__img"></a></div></section><footer class="footer"><a href="mailto:naiaralopess@gmail.com" class="footer__link">naiaralopess@gmail.com</a><ul class="social-list"><li class="social-list__item"><a class="social-list__link" href="https://github.com/nailopes"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></footer><script src="js/index.js"></script><script>!function(e){function r(r){for(var n,l,f=r[0],i=r[1],p=r[2],c=0,s=[];c<f.length;c++)l=f[c],Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,l)&&o[l]&&s.push(o[l][0]),o[l]=0;for(n in i)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(i,n)&&(e[n]=i[n]);for(a&&a(r);s.length;)s.shift()();return u.push.apply(u,p||[]),t()}function t(){for(var e,r=0;r<u.length;r++){for(var t=u[r],n=!0,f=1;f<t.length;f++){var i=t[f];0!==o[i]&&(n=!1)}n&&(u.splice(r--,1),e=l(l.s=t[0]))}return e}var n={},o={1:0},u=[];function l(r){if(n[r])return n[r].exports;var t=n[r]={i:r,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[r].call(t.exports,t,t.exports,l),t.l=!0,t.exports}l.m=e,l.c=n,l.d=function(e,r,t){l.o(e,r)||Object.defineProperty(e,r,{enumerable:!0,get:t})},l.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},l.t=function(e,r){if(1&r&&(e=l(e)),8&r)return e;if(4&r&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var t=Object.create(null);if(l.r(t),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&r&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var n in e)l.d(t,n,function(r){return e[r]}.bind(null,n));return t},l.n=function(e){var r=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return l.d(r,"a",r),r},l.o=function(e,r){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,r)},l.p="/portfolio/";var f=this.webpackJsonpportfolio=this.webpackJsonpportfolio||[],i=f.push.bind(f);f.push=r,f=f.slice();for(var p=0;p<f.length;p++)r(f[p]);var a=i;t()}([])</script><script src="/portfolio/static/js/main.28b7e6f2.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
